# Mac and Cheese

## Ingredients

* 6 slices good-quality white bread, turned to dust in a food processor
* 8 tablespoons butter
* 5 1/2 cups milk
* 1/2 cup flour
* 2 tsp kosher salt
* 1/4 tsp freshly grated nutmeg
* 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
* 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper
* 3 cups grated sharp cheddar
* 3 cups grated Mild cheddar
* 1 pound pasta of your choice
* 1 chopped jalapeño
* 1/2 tsp paprika

## Directions

Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Butter a 3-quart casserole dish; set aside. Place bread pieces in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Pour butter into the bowl with bread, and toss. Set the breadcrumbs aside. In a medium saucepan set over medium heat, heat milk. Melt remaining 6 tablespoons butter in a high-sided skillet over medium heat. When butter bubbles, add flour. Cook, stirring, 1 minute.

Fill a large saucepan with water. Bring to a boil. Add macaroni; cook 2 to 3 fewer minutes than manufacturer's directions, until outside of pasta is cooked and inside is underdone. (Different brands of macaroni cook at different rates; be sure to read the instructions.) Transfer the macaroni to a colander, rinse under cold running water, and drain well.

Slowly pour hot milk into flour-butter mixture while whisking. Continue cooking, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and becomes thick.

Remove the pan from the heat. Stir in salt, nutmeg, black pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, jalapeños, and all but 1/2 cup of both cheeses. Stir macaroni into the cheese sauce.

Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish. Sprinkle remaining cheese and scatter breadcrumbs over the top. Bake until browned on top, about 30 minutes. Transfer dish to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes; serve.
